# lein-reload

Leininge plugin to reload namespaces in modified files

## Usage

Add `[lein-reload "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]` to your `dev-dependencies` in
`project.clj`.

Start an interactive leiningen session

    lein interactive

test your code inside the leiningen shell

    lein> test

code to make it work, then reload and re-test

    lein> reload
    lein> test

reload will be fast, since it will only reload the files you modified
since last time.

If you want to automatically get a reload every time you test, you can add a hook
in your `project.clj` file

    :hooks [leiningen.hooks.reload-on-test]

Then in the leiningen shell, modified files will be reloaded every time you
call test, test! or retest, you don't need to call reload explicitly:

    lein> test
    lein> retest
